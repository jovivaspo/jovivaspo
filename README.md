<h2>FRONTEND SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h2> 

👋 Hi, I'm Jorge, Frontend Software Engineer with more than 4 years of experience. As an industrial engineer reconverted to the development world, I bring a perspective that combines analytical thinking with technical creativity.

🚀 What defines me?
▪️ Passionate about creating clean code and scalable architectures.
▪️ I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others grow.
▪️ Advocate of teamwork and transparent communication.
▪️ Always curious, always learning.

💻 Tech Stack
▪️ React, Next.js, TypeScript
▪️ Redux, Zustand, SWR
▪️ Testing (Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright)
▪️ Design and data visualization systems
▪️ Screaming Architecture
▪️ jira, Confluence, Notion, Git, Github
▪️ Java Spring Boot/Node (because I like the backend too!)

🎯 My approach.
I specialize in creating robust web solutions that combine technical excellence with business value. I firmly believe that the best software is born from efficient teams that enjoy working together and support each other to achieve common goals.

🌱 Beyond code.
My curiosity drives me to always be creating something new: from personal projects to AI experiments. And when I need to disconnect, nothing better than a good sports session to recharge my batteries.
