<h2>FRONTEND SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h2> 

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jorge, Frontend Software Engineer with more than 4 years of experience. As an industrial engineer reconverted to the development world, I bring a perspective that combines analytical thinking with technical creativity.

ðŸš€ What defines me?
- Passionate about creating clean code and scalable architectures.
- I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others grow.
- Advocate of teamwork and transparent communication.
- Always curious, always learning.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack
- React, Next.js, TypeScript
- Redux, Zustand, SWR
- Testing (Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright)
- Design and data visualization systems
- Screaming Architecture
- jira, Confluence, Notion, Git, Github
- Java Spring Boot/Node (because I like the backend too!)

ðŸŽ¯ My approach.
I specialize in creating robust web solutions that combine technical excellence with business value. I firmly believe that the best software is born from efficient teams that enjoy working together and support each other to achieve common goals.

ðŸŒ± Beyond code.
My curiosity drives me to always be creating something new: from personal projects to AI experiments. And when I need to disconnect, nothing better than a good sports session to recharge my batteries.
